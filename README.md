# Compressing-Images
On this notebook we will present 5 ways to compress an image. The methods that we are going to use are: 

- Single Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Fourier Transform 
- Wavelets Transform
- Kmeans 
- Autoencoder

A concise explanation of the methods will be given at the beggining of each section. The idea is to show the implementation of each algorithm, we will take a very simple approach regarding the tuning of each algorithm.
